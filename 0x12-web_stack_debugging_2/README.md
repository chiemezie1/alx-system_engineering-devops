# 0x12. Web Stack Debugging #2

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the security and configuration of web servers through debugging practices. This involves understanding and applying best practices to run software with appropriate permissions and ensuring proper server configurations.

## Concepts

### 1. Running Software as Another User

**Concept**: In Unix-like operating systems, the root user possesses unrestricted access to the entire system. Running software as the root user can pose significant security risks if the software is compromised. It is a best practice to execute services under a dedicated, non-privileged user account.

- **Importance**: Running applications under non-root users reduces the potential impact of a security breach. If an attacker gains control over a service, they have limited access, minimizing the damage.
- **Implementation**: This task involves creating a Bash script that switches the execution context of a command to a specified user. This ensures that commands or services operate with the intended privileges.

### 2. Running Nginx as the Nginx User

**Concept**: Nginx is a widely used web server that, by default, may run as the root user. For security reasons, it is advisable to configure Nginx to run under a less privileged user account, such as `nginx`.

- **Importance**: By configuring Nginx to run as the `nginx` user, you restrict its permissions to only what is necessary for it to function. This limits the scope of potential security vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of system-wide compromise.
- **Implementation**: This involves modifying Nginxâ€™s configuration to ensure that it runs under the `nginx` user and listens on the appropriate network interfaces and ports (e.g., port 8080). This configuration helps maintain a secure and efficient server environment.

### 3. Creating Concise Fixes

**Concept**: Efficiency in scripting is crucial for maintaining clarity and manageability. This task emphasizes writing compact and effective scripts to address configuration issues, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

- **Importance**: Concise scripts are easier to read, maintain, and debug. They help ensure that solutions are straightforward and avoid potential pitfalls associated with overly complex implementations.
- **Implementation**: The goal is to develop a Bash script that resolves the issue using the fewest lines of code while adhering to best practices and constraints. This promotes cleaner, more efficient scripting and
